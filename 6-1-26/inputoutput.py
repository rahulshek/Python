# This program takes an input from the user, evaluates it, and prints the value along with its type.
# a=eval(input("Enter a value: ")) # Evaluates the input and assigns it to variable 'a'
# print(a,type(a)) # Prints the value of 'a' and its type
                # Example usage:
                # If the user inputs: 42
                # The output will be: 42 <class 'int'>
                # If the user inputs: 3.14
                # The output will be: 3.14 <class 'float'>
                # If the user inputs: "Hello"
                # The output will be: Hello <class 'str'>




# a=eval(input("Enter a value: ")) #Evaluates the input and assigns it to variable 'a'
# print(f'The type of data is :',a) #Prints the type of 'a'
# print('The type of data is :',type(a))  #Prints the type of 'a'

# a=eval(input("Enter a value: ")) #Evaluates the input and assigns it to variable 'a'
# print(f'the  data is {a} and its type is :',type(a))  #Prints the value of 'a' and its type


# a=int(input("Enter first number: "))
# b=int(input("Enter second number: "))
# print("Sum:",a+b) # Output the sum of a and b
# print("Difference:",a-b)  # Output the difference of a and b  
# print("Product:",a*b) # Output the product of a and b
# print("Quotient:",a/b) # Output the quotient of a and b
# print("Integer Division:",a//b) # Output the integer division of a and b
# print("Remainder:",a%b) # Output the remainder of a divided by b
# print("Exponentiation:",a**b) # Output a raised to the power of b

a=int(input("Enter first number: "))# Takes first number as input and converts it to an integer
